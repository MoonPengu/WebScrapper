Hollaaa !! The application contains three features for now :

<p>👉 Network Analyser
<p>👉 Web Scrapper
<p>👉 System Monitoring

<p>This is a tool for taking website count click and generating graphs based on that. Also, another graph is generated that updates the website click traffics after 5 to 10 secs . 
<p>There is also a web scrapper , that import urls, grabs the ip address of it, fetch the email addressed and corresponding phone numbers.
<p>Lastly, another feature is system monitoring , which monitors the ram and cpu usage and shows percentage and graph with it .
